## Space Invaders

##### By: David and Brett Smith

_Target Hardware:_ ["DIY Gamer V1.9"](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2123) - an Arduino-based handheld game kit made by "Technology Will Save Us".

**Description:**  
I created a fun, from-scratch implementation of Space Invaders that runs on the DIY Gamer Arduino-based system. While it appears that the DIY Gamer is no longer manufactured, it can still be found for sale at electronics distributors like [Arrow](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/2123/adafruit-industries) and on sites like eBay.

**Gameplay:**  
As with the original Space Invaders, the object of the game is to kill all of the invaders before they can reach the bottom row and take over the planet. Move your defender's ship left and right while firing missiles at the invaders in an attempt to destroy them. Each time all of the invaders are destroyed, you advance to the next wave. In each wave, the invaders get progressively faster and harder to kill. See how many waves you can survive, and how many invaders you can kill!

**Controls:**

*   _Fire_: (Up Arrow) or (Down Arrow) or (Capacitive Touch Pad)
*   _Left_: (Left Arrow)
*   _Right_: (Right Arrow)
